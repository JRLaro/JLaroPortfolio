          Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a background in graphic design
          to provide creative solutions to complex issues. Earned a certificate
          in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Central Florida.
          Effective at combining creativity and technical problem
          solving to develop user-friendly applications.  I have always had a
          passion for creating, constructing and collaborating. There is nothing
          more satisfying than taking a conceptual idea and
          turning it into reality, whether that be a fully functional Web
          application or graphical design.
